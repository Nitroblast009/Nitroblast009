### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Faizaan A. I'm currently a high school student who is enthusiastic about computers and loves to learn new things. I've played around with many programming languages and technologies including HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript (plus React.js, Discord JS, etc.), TypeScript, XML, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Java, Python, Ruby, C (for Arduino), C++, Lua, Dart (including Flutter), and even more!

At this point in time, I want to improme my problem solving skills, so I'm grinding on Leetcode as much as I can; I'm also responsible for managing the website of a youth organization and have been bettering my web-related knowledge there. I keep most of my projects stored locally though, since it's always a hassle to sync everything to GitHub, but nonetheless, I've uploaded a few that I'm especially proud of here.

Outside of computers, I'm interested as well in learning new languages during my free time - these include French, Urdu, and Japanese. This is because, in the future, I want to not only become a proficient software developer but a polyglot too. This will allow me to connect with computer lovers from all across the world and work with a diverse set of talented people.

As for my current *magnum opus*, I'm working on developing an app for said youth organization...

Virtually yours,<br />
Faizaan ðŸ˜„
